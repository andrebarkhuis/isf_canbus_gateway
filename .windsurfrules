Implementation Guidelines
To ensure consistent, high-quality contributions from the AI agent across this project, please follow these rules:

Primary References
Always consult the docs/ folder, and the Techstream_uds_logs/ folder before making any code changes.
If any instructions in docs/ are unclear, prioritize examples and patterns found in the Techstream_uds_logs/ folder.
Treat the UDS logs in Techstream_uds_logs/ as the authoritative ground truth for UDS message formats and content. When handling or interpreting UDS messages, trust and align your implementation to the patterns in these logs. The Lexus ISF canbus messages are defined in the docs/LexusI ISF Canbus Message Definitions.json file.
Regularly review the markdown readme files to make sure the code still aligns. If it not aligns, update the code to align with the .md files.

Code Style Guidelines
Follow the code style guidelines defined in code-guidelines.md to ensure consistency and maintainability across the codebase.

Building Arduino Application
The application is built using the Arduino framework. If the build fails try to resolve the issue by checking the error message and the codebase.
If the build fails, try to resolve the issue by checking the error message and the codebase.
Run this command to clean the build: "Remove-Item -Recurse -Force *.o,*.d; if (Test-Path ../.pio) { Remove-Item -Recurse -Force ../.pio }; arduino-cli cache clean"

Directory Layout
Ensure the Directory Layout is updated if any new folders are added.
