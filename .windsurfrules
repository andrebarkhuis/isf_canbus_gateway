Implementation Guidelines
To ensure consistent, high-quality contributions from the AI agent across this project, please follow these rules:

Primary References
Always consult Techstream.md, Readme.md, and the Techstream_uds_logs/ folder before making any code changes.
If any instructions in Techstream.md or Readme.md are unclear, prioritize examples and patterns found in the Techstream_uds_logs/ folder.
Treat the UDS logs in Techstream_uds_logs/ as the authoritative ground truth for UDS message formats and content. When handling or interpreting UDS messages, trust and align your implementation to the patterns in these logs.

Source Code Scope
Only modify files within the src/ directory. Do not alter configuration or documentation outside this folder unless explicitly instructed.

Commenting
Add concise, meaningful comments that explain why the code exists or what it intends to accomplish.
Avoid comments that simply restate the code (e.g., do not write "// increment counter" for counter++;).

Variable Management
Before introducing any new variable or function, search the existing codebase to ensure a similar variable or abstraction does not already exist.
Reuse or extend existing constructs when possible to keep the code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).

Clean Code Principles
Follow established clean code practices: small functions, single responsibility, meaningful naming, and consistent formatting.
Keep methods and classes small and focused; refactor when a function exceeds 30–40 lines or has multiple responsibilities.
